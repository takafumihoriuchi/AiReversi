# AiReversi
creating a game of reversi from scratch Â 
- game1.py: ai with simple algorithm of greedy search; with GUI; need adjustment with interval between player and ai
- logic1.py: ai with simple algorithm of greedy search; i/o via command line; designed object oriented
- game.py: in the middle of implementing ai with TensorFlow
- logic.py: in the middle of implementing ai with TensorFlow

## to run
install python and run by "python (file name).py"  
"logic1.py" is currently the best organized code
